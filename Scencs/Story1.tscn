to create an A.I that can react to random unpredictable physics, but the
A.Is that succedded learned how the abnormal physics of this simulation
works  instead of learning how to react to the random environment.
On 11/01/2020 the project was shutdown and all ## A.Is were
exterminated. But I couldn't lose hope so I kept a copy of the project
and a copy of the best A.I \"Subject @@\" to continue the project.
On 9/04/2020 I increased the randomness of the simulation and I
started a new simulation."
